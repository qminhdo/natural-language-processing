8-5-78

Last October, when Brazilian soccer virtuoso Pel played his final game
as a professional, nearly 76,000 fans filed into Giant Stadium in East
Rutherford, New Jersey to bid farewell to the man who had almost single
handedly transformed soccer into a major American sport. It was a fitting
cap to Pel's career that his team, the Cosmos, won the North American
Soccer League championship last season over 23 other teams.

But while the Brazilian superstar was reaping most of the publicity, one
of his teammates, Franz Beckenbauer, was quietly getting things done. It
was probably he, more than anyone else, who won the title for the
Cosmos -- not by scoring goals, but by controlling the midfield with his
pinpoint touch passes and setting up the offense to go in for the shot.

In May, 1977, he shocked the sports world by quitting his West German
team, Bayern Munich, and signing a $2.8 million contract to play with the
Cosmos for four years. And though he missed one-third of the 1977
season, Franz still received last year's Most Valuable Player award for a
league encompassing 600 players from around the world. This season
again, thanks largely to his efforts, the Cosmos clinched their division title
and are a heavy favorite to repeat their victory in the Soccer Bowl -- the
Super Bowl of soccer. This year the Soccer Bowl will be held in Giant
Stadium on August 27. To be in that game, the Cosmos must first win in
the playoffs, which begin on August 8.
